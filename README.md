# C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO
This project is done in the aim of learning all about how **Stacks** and **Queues** work in **C**. and created a **Monty** program Interpreter at **ALX Full Stack Software Engineering** program.

## Description

### The Monty language
Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.

### Monty byte code files
Files containing Monty byte codes usually have the .m extension. Most of the industry uses this standard but it is not required by the specification of the language. There is not more than one instruction per line. There can be any number of spaces before or after the opcode and its argument:

## Technologies
* **C** files are compiled with **gcc**
* **Shell** files are written in **Bash**
* Tested on **UBUNTU 20.04 LTS**

## Instructions
You can Compile the program Using:
```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o monty
```
